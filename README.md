# PythonToolbox
ArcGIS Pro Python toolbox for the "Solar Panel Suitability" geoprocessing tool. This tool was developed as my final project in USC SSI's graduate level GIS Programming and Customization course.

The "Solar Suitability Tools.pyt" file can be uploaded to an ArcGIS Pro project as a python toolbox for the custom script tool to be run on any DEM given as input.
